# In python there is no need to give specific type everytime
# For ex -
x = 5
y = "Some name"
print(x)
print(y)

# String variables can be declared using either single or double quotes
name1 = "Name in double quotes"
name2 = 'Name in single quotes'
print(name1)
print(name2)

# Variable names are case-sensitive
variable_one = 4
vArIaBlE_oNe = "another variable"
print(variable_one)
print(vArIaBlE_oNe)
